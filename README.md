# Loan Status Prediction using Random Forest Algorithm
This project is focused on predicting the loan status (approved or not approved) using the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset used for training and testing the model is taken from Kaggle.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 148670 observations and 32 attributes. The target variable is Loan_Status and the rest of the attributes are used as predictors. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical data.

# Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run this project:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
joblib
Files
loan_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, model training and evaluation steps.
loan_prediction.py: Python file containing the final code for the project.
loan_prediction_model.pkl: Saved model using joblib.
loan_prediction_data.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
# Running the Code
To run the code, open the loan_prediction.py file in a Python environment (Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, PyCharm, etc.) and run the code.

# Results
The model was trained using Random Forest algorithm and achieved an accuracy of  98% on the test set.

# Conclusion
The Random Forest algorithm is an effective method for predicting loan status with high accuracy. With further improvements in data quality and feature engineering, the model can be further improved for better predictions.http://faizal2224.pythonanywhere.com/
